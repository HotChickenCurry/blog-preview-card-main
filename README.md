## Overview
This challenge was to build a QR code component based on a provided design. The goal was to practice semantic HTML, CSS styling, including adding hover and focus state and responsive layout basics.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process
I started with structuring with semantic HTML tags. Then, I set up Tailwind CSS and customized styles following the Figma design guide. I used flexbox and flex-grow to center the content vertically with a footer pinned at the bottom. I also added hover and focus states

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- How to use flex-grow for vertical centering with a footer
- Setting up smooth hover and focus transitions in Tailwind
- Manipulating shadows dynamically with JavaScript for a subtle effect

### Continued development

Next, I want to make the drop shadow dynamic so it follows the userâ€™s cursor, adding an interactive and engaging effect to the component.
